# Linear_regression_model
A multi-linear regression model on Texas police HR data. 
The aim was to create a model to predict the salary of a police officer based on sex, age, job title, and race. I did some data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering, aggregation, and exploratory data analysis on the dataset. 
Here are some of my interesting discoveries: 
1. There are no female directors
2. Directors aren't the most experienced (if counted by years at job), yet the highest paid
3. All directors are male and white
4. There are more female captains
5. Troopers and lieutenants have the most experience, but their combined pay doesn't reach Director VII's pay
6. There are more black troopers

This is an example of using data analytics methods to examine the economics of race and gender.
